What's Quadro?
==============

It's a small Qt[1] program written to emulate the behaviour of Brushes app [2]
for iPhone. It's a simple paint program, with layers, brushes and undo system
and my first try to program using Qt toolkit. If you need a real paint program
for your mobile get an iPhone and install brushes app ;)

How to install quadro
=====================

You need to have Qt installed in your phone. So you need:

 - STDCPP_s60_1_6_SS.sis
 - pips_s60_1_6_SS.sis
 - openc_ssl_s60_1_6_SS.sis
 - qt.sis

After having satisfied all dependencies you could install the quadro sis file.
For documentation please refer to [3].
